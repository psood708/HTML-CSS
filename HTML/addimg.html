<!-- if we need to add images we do img src it doesnt have any closing tag
and if we need to organize a bit and add a folder we need to first mention 
the folder name like Images then put a forward slash then file name
like-- Images/tokyo.jpeg -->

<!-- for going up the folder for example if file is inside another folder and want to operate
an image outside the folder of many folder outside we use
-- "../xyz.jpeg" -->
